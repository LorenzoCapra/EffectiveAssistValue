How to run the code?

Well, not a coder here, so not much is automated. First you need to run TEAM_EAV.py to produce the first dataframe that will be saved in a generated CSV folder. Secondly you should run PLAYERS_EAV.py.
Once you have successfully run these two files you can then obtain some results by running Results.py. For now this file simply rank all the players by average EAV over a season. 
As you run the Results.py file, you will obtain also a csv comprising all the players with the respective average EAV value, called "PLAYERS_EAV" (note they are the players reamining from the filtering applied on the minimum number of games played).
